# Stat-Mech-Solutions
I uploaded few calculations and descriptions for solving problems in the textbook called "An introduction to thermal physics." by Schroeder, Daniel V.
I hope you like it. If there's any other problems you need for solutions and calculations, please add a commit. 
I would be my pleasure to help you out.
