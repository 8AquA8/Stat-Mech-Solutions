# Stat-Mech-Solutions
I uploaded few calculations and descriptions for problems in the textbook called "An introduction to thermal physics" by Schroeder, Daniel V.
I hope you like it. If there's any other problems you need for solutions and calculations, please add in the commit. 
I'm happy to help you out.
